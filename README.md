# ODE_Solver

In the first sprint of the project, we have implemented an explicit Euler Scheme.
We did not use classes for the first part of the project because it was not necessary.
In the first part, we are taking the initial points of x and y from the user.
After that, we are taking the final point of x and the step size from the user.
After we took all the necessary information from the user, we are ready to get in to 
the function that we designed. This function can be changed by rewriting the polynomial.
Taking the polynomial from the user is a little bit hard for us for now.
Final y point is calculated using the function that we determined(which is also can be changed 
by the user).
